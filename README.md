# Plotly_Project

## Overview of the project

The purpose of this analysis is to provide insightful bacterial information for each volunteer, so they are able to identify the Top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons.

## Summary

 To facilitate the visualization of the analysis, we created a set of different charts and a dynamic dashboard using a JavaScript code.

The dynamic dashboard included information such as: **Demographics** and **Type of Bacteria** per volunteer.
